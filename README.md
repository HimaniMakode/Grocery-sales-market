#Grocery Sales Market Study & Data Analysis

## Project Outline:  
We find the grocery market an interesting study. We hope to derive insights that might help us to find business efficiencies and areas for growth. In order to do so we analyzed a series of datasets we pulled from Kaggle.

### Evaluate the relationship between common Allergic and Non-Allergic Products groups:
We were able to derive and visualize that the quantity sold per product was very similar per Allergy group and that the most sold allergic product was decaf coffee and the most sold non-allergic products were egg rolls.  We also noticed that Category may not be a reliable feature of the dataset because the name of the product was of not associated with the logical Category. 

### What is the normal distribution of customers over all cities for the Grocery Market?
We built a table showing the top 5 cities with the most and least customers and the identified a normal distribution of customers over all cities. We used a T-test to compare customers in California to customers in all cities and found that customers in all cities are almost same which cannot be true in real scenario.

### Can we identify total sales revenue per product in grocery sales market? 
We joined the Products and Sales tables just to find what was the revenue or total sales made per product, hoping to identify a linear distribution on which items are popular/have maximum sales and which are less popular/have minimum sales so that it is visible to the owner of the Grocery Market to identify which products he/she can eliminate from their listing. However, having a scatter plot of Quantity Sold vs Price did not give us a very linear progression. Also, it wasn't true that the most sold product had less price and least sold product had the maximum price. Data gave a very averagely distributed message on items sold.

When on the other hand we plotted a bar graph we came to know that data showed more clear information of how much sales for each item was made. From there we could sort the data and show the most popular and least popular items. If we could sort this more via each city of the country, then there will be a nice outcome of popularity of items across the countries as an enhancement.

For example, we deduced after sorting the bar graph data - Which is the most popular product and least priced product"- it’s just an analysis where I have compared 'Zucchini' which is most sold product against other products. Also, 'Chef hat' as the least priced product.

### What’s going on here? Why don’t we stop selling steak, and start selling more zucchini? 

If we DID…
Would total store profits drop?  Maybe because steak is a lost leader driving in all of the zucchini traffic...? 

Does it cost more to sell zucchini and are the Cogs margins on zucchini weaker than steak? 

Or… would profits increase due to improved labor efficiencies?  Let’s look at our
Employees.

### Analyze sales transaction productivity per employee
The average transaction size is about the same for each Employee. That means each employee sells the same number of products per transaction. 

### How about the Total Transactions per Employee?
Each employee has been processing almost the exact same number of transactions.
That means each employee generates the same number of sales per average hour worked.

### So, is the Cost of Labor is fixed?
The employee and sales analysis make evident that the average labor cost associated with the acquisition of one sales transaction across an average of all products is relatively fixed. 

Assuming that the COGs margin for each product sold is the same for each product, and there are no lost leaders, why not sell just the top few products? 

Maybe because it takes more time to process a Zucchini transaction vs. a Steak transaction because Zucchinis take less time to process than steaks?  That analysis is for another time…

Or… would Profits increase because we are more effectively allocating our fixed labor costs towards selling products that generate substantially more revenue per transaction?

Get rid of Steak?!!!
Something is fishy here.  Let’s look at the Data.

### Conclusion
It looks like false advertising...
Measure twice, cut once.
Use common sense and spend more time reviewing data before digging in too deep with analysis.
